# Hello, there!

I'm theSixth, the leader, programmer, designer, director, writer and musician of the MonochromeBird development team.
I'm work addicted and I'm always learning something new or working at some of my projects. I have quite a lot of things planned and I will post something about those things as soon as I finish at least a fully functional build.

Some info about my account. (thanks to https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats üòÑ)

# What do I like to do the most?

# What have I already done?

I made a game to the [Game Jaaj 7](https://itch.io/jam/game-jaaj-7) with my artist friend [HRB](https://twitter.com/hrbartist) called ‚Äú[Breaking out A.B.B.Y](https://monochromebird.itch.io/breaking-out-abby)‚Äù in 7 days.
It isn't all it could be because of the time we had to do it. That's why I'm working on it again to extend the gameplay, fix all the bugs, fix the cutscenes and etc.

I also did some other couple of things but it isn't public because I'm remaking it to perfection.
